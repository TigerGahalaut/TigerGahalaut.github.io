    <p class = "content">The COVID-19 pandemic was an event that reverberated through every facet of society, and the city of
      Chicago was no exception. The changes brought about by COVID influenced every aspect of urban life, especially
      crime. We can see from the trend line below that the lockdowns that occurred in 2020 and 2021 caused the crime rate
      to significantly decrease. This was to be expected. However, the circumstances of COVID has also led to unexpected surges in
      other types of criminal activity. For example, violent crimes like homicide and arson saw a marked increase. The economic 
      hardship brought about by the pandemic led to increased stress and desperation among many individuals, which in turn fueled
      violent behavior. Job losses, financial instability, and the strain of prolonged isolation created a volatile environment. Explore 
      the line graph to observe how the rates of these and other crimes rates have changed throughout the pandemic. You can switch 
      between yearly and monthly trends using the toggle button.</p>

  <div id="scatter-text" style="display: none; text-align: center; margin: 20px;">
    <p class = "content"> This scatterplot visualizes the relationship between crime rates and median household income across different community areas
       in Chicago. Notice a general negative correlation between income and crime rate, indicating that more affluent communities
       tend to experience lower crime.  The impact of COVID-19 on these trends is significant, as the pandemic exacerbated socioeconomic disparities. 
       Lower-income communities, which already faced higher crime rates, experienced further strain due to economic hardships, job losses, and limited
       access to resources during the lockdown periods. Meanwhile, more affluent communities were better equipped to manage the challenges brought by the 
       pandemic, resulting in less dramatic changes in crime rates. Click on the dropdown menus explore these trends and gain a better ideas of how 
       socioeconomic factors and the pandemic influenced crime rates in Chicago's various communities. </p>
       <p class = "content"> The Loop is an outlier among the high-income communities. This is because it is a major commercial and cultural hub, attracting a large number of 
        people daily, including tourists, workers, and residents. The high density and constant flow of people create more opportunities for crimes like theft, robbery, and assault.
        Furthermore, the Loop is home to many high-end stores, banks, and businesses, making it an attractive target for crimes like burglary, shoplifting, and financial fraud. </p>

  <div id="heatmap-text" style="display: none; text-align: center; margin: 20px;">
    <p class = "content"> We can clearly see that virtually every community of Chicago experienced a drop in crime during COVID, followed by an increase in crime as the pandemic
      subsided. We can also see the stark disparities in crime rates across different parts of the city. For example, the South Side of Chicago is known to be one of the most dangerous places 
      areas of Chicago, and notice how it consistently experiences higher crime rates compared to other areas. In contrast, the North Side, which includes many of the city's more affluent 
      neighborhoods, exhibits lower crime rates. The fact that the South Side of Chicago is also where the poorer, more marginalized communities have historically been shows how the
      geographical distribution of crime in Chicago is deeply rooted in the city's history of segregation and economic disparity. During the pandemic, these disparities became even more pronounced 
      as lower-income communities, primarily in the South, faced greater economic hardship and limited access to resources. Explore the heat map to gain a comprehensive understanding of how different 
      communities reacted to the pandemic compared to each other and the geographical patterns that shaped these trends. </p>

  <div id="map" style="display: none;"></div>
  <div id="bar-text" style="display: none; text-align: center; margin: 20px;">
    <p class = "content"> During the pandemic, with the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing measures, there was a noticeable shift in the locations where crimes occurred.
      Public spaces, which traditionally saw high crime rates, experienced a decline as fewer people were out and about. Conversely, residential areas saw an increase in 
      crime rates, as more people were confined to their homes. This shift in crime locations underscores how the pandemic altered daily routines and social behaviors, 
      thereby influencing where and how crimes were committed. Use the dropdown menu to see how the location of crime has been affected throughout the pandemic. </p>
